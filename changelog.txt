Changelog

1.8
	Feature: Per-vessel profiles
      	Feature: Draggable, pinnable windows
      	Feature: surface sample at top
 
1.7 
      	Feature: ApplicationLauncher (stock toolbar) support
      	Feature: Blizzy's toolbar is now optional. If you have it installed,
               	you can choose between the stock toolbar and Blizzy's toolbar
               	in the options menu
      	Feature: (Option) Experiment buttons can show next report value
      	Feature: (Option) EVA report button can be set to always appear at
               	the top of the list
      	Feature: (Option) Surface sample availability can now be tracked while
               	not on EVA. Surface sample button while not EVA'ing will cause
               	kerbal to go EVA
      	Feature: (Option) Experiment popup can be configured to automatically
               	reappear on EVA if it was visible before leaving the vessel
      	Bugfix: Fixed issue that caused the popup windows to flicker (especially
              	the options window)
     
      	Note: Sound config (other than per-experiment and global on/off) settings 
            	were removed while making some changes to the audio system. 
            
      
1.6
      	Bugfix: Fixed issue where alerts could appear for science reports worth
              	no science
              
      	Bugfix: Rapidly disintegrating vessels could sometimes cause an issue
              	that spammed KeyNotFound exceptions
              
      	Bugfix: Biome map filter function could sometimes be interrupted and
              	be left in a bad state, causing ScienceAlert to stop reporting
              	science
              
      	Bugfix: Biome map filter function could, in rare circumstances, produce
              	a wrong result
 
1.5
      	Feature: you can now set a minimum threshold for a science report
          	If performing an experiment won't result in at least that much
          	science, then it will be ignored even if it would otherwise match
          	your filter settings
          
      	Small UI improvement: added a collapsing section where new
          options can be added
          
      	Fixed an issue where the biome filter could sometimes
          ignore biome
          
      	Fixed an issue caused by last version's fix which could make
          the flight camera and map camera active at the same time if
          the player goes on eva with an active map view
          
          
1.4a
      	Fixed an issue where game would use the incorrect camera
          after ejecting an eva kerbal, potentially causing a crash
          
1.4
      	Fixed an issue that could cause ScienceAlert to spew NREs when
          the orbited body didn't have a biome map
          
1.3
      	Fixed a serious issue: ScienceAlert wasn't taking science
          multipliers into account correctly which could result in
          incorrect alerts
          
      	Added a global warp setting option
      
      	Added a global alert sound setting option
      
      	Log spam due to vessel modification reduced
 
      	Experiments that rely on custom code to determine availability
          will now be hidden from the options window, since ScienceAlert
          will be unable to interact with them (determined by checking
          if that experiment's biome and situation mask flags are zero)
 
 
1.2
      	Fixed a serious issue: "stop on discovery" could sometimes affect
          orbital parameters, especially at high warp
          
      	Further tweaked biome detection. There should no longer be any
          instances of incorrect science alerts
 
1.1
      	Added EVA condition warning
      
      	Fixed issue where base function of ModuleScienceExperiment was called
          instead of the correct one
          
      	Fixed issue where ScienceAlert would detect the wrong biome and flash
          the icon at the incorrect time
          
      	Stock experiments no longer have "Assume onboard" option display
          by default (to reduce clutter)
          
      	Temporarily added a debug menu, accessable using default settings by
          middle-mouse clicking the toolbar button
          
      	Available experiment menu polished a little; will now appear in the
          same location consistently
 
1.0
      	First public release
