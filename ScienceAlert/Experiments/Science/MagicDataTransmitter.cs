    /// When the user decides to transmit data, the game selects "the best"
    /// antenna to use and moves the ScienceData out of its experiment or
    /// container into the transmitter.  This poses us two problems:
    ///   1) There's no way for us to get at the data to be transmitted, so
    ///      we don't know which info is being transmitted (or when it was, no event)
    ///   2) Since the data was taken out of storage, we temporarily lose
    ///      track of it until the transmitter has finished submitting it
    ///      
    /// As a result, while we're examining a given experiment to see if 
    /// it should trigger a response we might find no info in R&D and no
    /// info in storage resulting in the plugin erroneously concluding that
    /// the experiment is fresh in the interim time while the results are
    /// being transmitted by an antenna.
    /// 
    /// This method involves tricking the game into thinking there's a fake
    /// transmitter on the vessel. Whenever it goes looking for a transmitter
    /// to use, our magic version will score highest and be chosen. It will
    /// receive the data to be transmitted and delegate that data to real
    /// transmitters itself.
    /// 
    /// There are a couple of edge cases to be solved still, however. For
    /// instance, a player can manually select a transmitter, click "transmit"
    /// and bypass this transmitter. I haven't fixed this yet because I still
    /// need to determine whether anyone actually uses this method of transmission.
    /// 
    /// Note: Why not use MM to edit the transmitter module itself with our own
    /// version? It will contaminate the player's save. Also I'm experimenting 
    /// with adding PartModules on-the-fly
